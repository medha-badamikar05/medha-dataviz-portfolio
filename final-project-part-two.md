# User research 

## Target audience
My primary audience is business officials and analysts at major airlines such as Delta, who play a key role in shaping strategies around customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and airport partnerships. I propose the hypothesis that airport satisfaction significantly contributes to overall airline satisfaction, providing an opportunity for analysts to explore this relationship in depth.

While airline officials remain the central focus, I also aim for this story to reach a wider set of stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem, including airport authorities and industry regulators, (anyone who is vested in Delta). By examining how airlines operate—particularly through analysis of cancellation trends over time—we can identify opportunities to design improvements that mitigate reputational risks, strengthen passenger trust, and ultimately support long-term growth and retention.



## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Clarity, conveying intent   |        Is the title clear? Is the flow of the story clear?      |
|  Clean design   |    Do you think the wireframes are cluttered?              |
|  Contextual awareness : Simplicity   |      Did you find it hard to understand or read the charts? Would you improve anything?             |
|  Persuasion  |        What do you think about the story? Do you think business officials would be engaged in this?         |


## Interview findings

The in-class interviews helped me gather diverse perspectives.

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|  Is the title clear? Is the flow of the story clear?   |   Yes, the story is clear and the flow is good too!      |   The current title raises curiosity but doesn’t directly connect to the business value for airline executives. Adding words like “Passenger Experience,” or “Brand Perception” would make it more relevant for business analysts and officials.          |    The flow seems to move logically, but it may call to action. For business officials, stories need to highlight risks and opportunities quickly. Maybe you can begin with a provocative question or tension point (“Why do passengers trust Delta most, even as cancellations rise?”)         |
| Do you think the wireframes are cluttered?        |    No, the design is lucid it conveys the story well                            |     The wireframes are neat and spaced out well. The color coding and consistency can be improved        |     The design is simple and effective, something that does not overwhelm the audience         |
|  Did you find it hard to understand or read the charts? Would you improve anything?     |    No, the charts were clear and straightforward. I especially liked that the rankings were easy to compare side by side. If anything, I’d suggest adding color-coding to highlight the key data     |      I didn’t have trouble understanding the charts, but some of the labels felt a missing. It might help to include short explanatory notes under each chart so I don’t have to refer back to the text for context.       |     The information was easy to follow. What could make it even better is including a quick legend or key, so I immediately know what the scores represent without scanning the description below.        |
|  What do you think about the story? Do you think business officials would be engaged in this?       |    The story shows a compelling paradox: Delta is widely seen as reliable, yet operational metrics suggest otherwise. Business officials would likely be engaged by this because it challenges brand perception with hard data.                         |     The story is unique and interesting. However, for maximum impact, the narrative should emphasize business consequences (e.g., customer churn, revenue loss, loyalty program impacts)          |     To make it more engaging, highlight the factor: why does this discrepancy matter now? What risks or opportunities does it present for Delta in comparison to competitors? Adding more visuals would help   |


# Identified changes for Part III 

For Part 3 I will work on finalizing the sequence

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The labels and legends seem incomplete and missing  | The charts on Datawrapper need to be annotated well with more details |
| The call to action needs to be improved and should be highlighted     |       Another 2-3 visualizations would be added to  support the problem and work on highlighting the call to action                                                                         |
|                        The width of one line chart is high                  |   Width and layout of the charts will be made consistent |
