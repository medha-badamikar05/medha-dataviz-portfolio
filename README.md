# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I am Medha! I am a MISM 16 student here at Heinz College. As a Software Engineer, I specialize in building scalable and user-centric applications. With hands-on experience in Spring Boot, React JS, and Python, I've delivered multiple full stack solutions — from automating manual work orders to building migration applications that scale with growing customer needs. I've created interactive Splunk dashboards to monitor job processing in real-time, helping teams respond faster and smarter.

I’m skilled at writing clean code, debugging complex issues, and supporting critical systems. I stay adaptable under changing circumstances and thrive in team-driven, fast-paced environments. 

# What I hope to learn

1. Data visualisation 
2. Effectively communicating the story of data 
3. I am planning to take up Software Engineer and Data analyst roles after graduation

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Data visualization critique #1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CzrOcL2Odi-c4bULJAGIloIEvDMdLkqJU4LuR-_ZJ0/edit?usp=sharing)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page. This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)
 

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
