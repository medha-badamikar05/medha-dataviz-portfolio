# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/caffeine-levels-in-high-street-coffees-vary-significantly-which-finds-ay7cA4G1zh1S

I am a coffee buff, and as soon as I discovered this article on caffeine content, I was drawn to it. When I saw the visualization, it required some effort to go back and forth to understand and compare the numbers - ranking low on intuitiveness and usefulness  (ref. Stephen Few's)
  
Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

## Step two: the critique
### What Worked Well:
*	The visualization is clean and uncluttered.
*	The consistent use of just three colors (blue, black, and white) adds to the simplicity and visual appeal.
*	The title is aligned with the table’s purpose and stands out with bold styling.
*	The coffee cup icons add an aesthetic touch that connects well with the theme.
*	The legend is clear and intuitive, requiring no extra effort to interpret.
*	(A personal note: the coffee imagery resonates well, perhaps because data feels more engaging when tied to something relatable like coffee.)
### What Didn’t Work Well:
*	The numeric values appear scattered without any visible pattern (e.g., increasing or decreasing), which reduces readability.
*	The drink size in brackets is redundant—this detail could instead be conveyed once in the table header.
*	The chart doesn’t enable quick comparisons or highlight key takeaways at first glance.
*	While the title introduces the subject, it doesn’t guide the reader toward a story or insight, leaving them to interpret the data on their own.
*	The use of “n/a” is ambiguous and may mislead readers into thinking certain drinks lack caffeine altogether, which undermines the chart’s purpose.

The main audience for this visualization is anyone who buys coffee from high-street coffee chains such as Costa and Starbucks. It’s relevant to because everyone would want to know how much caffeine they consume through drinks purchased at these chains. This data warns customers of overconsumption of caffeine. 
While the current visualization presents the information in a structured table, it is not very effective at telling a clear story because:
*	The table cells contain too many numbers, which can overwhelm the viewer.
*	The data is not organized in descending order of caffeine content, making comparisons difficult.
*	The numbers are shown only as text, without visual encoding through shapes or colors, which would make the information quicker and easier to understand.
## Step three: Sketch a solution
In my redesign sketch, I would start by removing redundant details, such as the drink sizes in brackets, to keep the visualization clean and easy to read. My next focus would be on improving clarity by sorting the data and emphasizing the most relevant comparisons. For example, it would be useful to highlight that Costa Coffee consistently offers drinks with higher caffeine content than Starbucks, and ensure this stands out clearly in the visualization.

I’m also excited to experiment with visual encodings that go beyond plain numbers. One idea is to use coffee cup icons whose size or fill level corresponds to the amount of caffeine in each drink. This would provide a more intuitive, engaging way for viewers to grasp differences at a glance. At the same time, I’m considering more conventional approaches such as bar charts, which are excellent for side-by-side comparisons between vendors and drink types.

Following are the initial versions (sketches drawn by hand) of my redesign

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
